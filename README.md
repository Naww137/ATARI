AI/ML Tool for Automated Resonance Identification

This is the repository for scripts, documents, and other resources relevant to the ATARI project, a part of Noah Walton's PhD research at the University of Tennessee.

The Performance Testing for Fitting Algorithm (PiTFAll) module can be used a framework for generating large sets of synthetic data, fitting them with a 'black box' fitting routine, and analyzing the results.
