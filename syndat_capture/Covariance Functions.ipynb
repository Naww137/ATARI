    "It's designed to take data that has it's uncertainty either tagged as a full covariance matrix or simply an uncertainty list and performe the best reduction for that. It also takes in the function derivatives as inputs rather than doing them in the function body. So this is going to take a bit of reworking to get in the right state. By the way, I for some reason started calling the covariance matrix the jacobian. Not really sure why, but that's why the namings off here.\n",

    "As is, the function should be pretty versitile though. If you have covariance between different data points than normal it should be able to handle that. As it stands, that's pretty useless, but if there's ever a use case for that, it might be worth checking. Storing the full covariance matrix for the data though is pretty extreme and I don't think is neccisary unless you have very well defined covariance, so a simple matrix construction is useful."
